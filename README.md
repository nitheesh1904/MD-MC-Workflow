## Interface energy and segregation calculation  using LAMMPS and Monte-carlo simulations 
This repository contains a detailed end-to-end workflow for calculating interface energy using LAMMPS. 
The calculations are illustrated by taking Ni-Fe alloy system, and can be followed for any alloy system given that you have the related potential file.
